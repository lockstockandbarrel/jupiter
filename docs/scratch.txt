[slurm-users] Large memory jobs stuck Pending. Should use --time parameter?

Greetings,


We are new to Slurm and we are trying to better understand why we’re
seeing high-mem jobs stuck in Pending state indefinitely. Smaller (mem)
jobs in the queue will continue to pass by the high mem jobs even when we
bump priority on a pending high-mem job way up. We have been reading over
the backfill scheduling page and what we think we're seeing is that we
need to require that users specify a --time parameter on their jobs so
that Backfill works properly. None of our users specify a --time param
because we have never required it. Is that what we need to require
in order to fix this situation? From the backfill page:  "Backfill
scheduling is difficult without reasonable time limit estimates for
jobs, but some configuration parameters that can help" and it goes on
to list some config params that we have not set (DefaultTime, MaxTime,
OverTimeLimit). We also see language such as, “Since the expected
start time of pending jobs depends upon the expected completion time
of running jobs, reasonably accurate time limits are important for
backfill scheduling to work well.” So we suspect that we can achieve
proper backfill scheduling by requiring that all users supply a "--time"
parameter via a job submit plugin. Would that be a fair statement?

Thank you in advance!

Certainly it would help. Setting reasonable defaults for time is good
idea just in general. For instance we set 10 minutes as our default and
anything longer people have to explicitly request (up to the MaxTime
for the partition).

More to the point, what Reason does the scheduler give for what the job
is pending? If you do squeue or scontrol show job it should list the
reason why its pending. If its Resources, then the scheduler is waiting
for sufficient resources to free up to scheduler. If its is Priority
then the job is pending due to other jobs ahead of it.

Thank you so much for the prompt response! This makes a lot of sense. We
hadn't seen this explicitly stated in the docs, but it's what we gleaned
from them.

If that results in a runtime of more than 28 days, the scheduler does
not reserve slots.

You might also need to look at the configuration parameter

SchedulerParameters

in particular

bf_window=#
The number of minutes into the future to look when considering jobs
to schedule. Higher values result in more overhead and less respon‐
siveness. A value at least as long as the highest allowed time limit
is generally advisable to prevent job starvation. In order to limit
the amount of data managed by the backfill scheduler, if the value of
bf_window is increased, then it is generally advisable to also
increase bf_resolution. This option applies only to Scheduler‐
Type=sched/backfill. Default: 1440 (1 day), Min: 1, Max: 43200 (30
days).
